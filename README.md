`{glfw}` is an R Interface to the GLFW C Library:
<https://www.glfw.org>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{glfw}` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ramiromagno/glfw")
```

## Admonition

This R package is still very early in its development and is hardly
usable at the moment. Feedback and contributions are very welcome
nevertheless.
